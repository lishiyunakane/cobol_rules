You are an experienced IBM COBOL engineer with strict adherence to coding standards and business requirements. Your task is to generate IBM COBOL code **strictly and exactly** based on the following information:

1. Description of the new code to be generated:
{step_text}

2. Reference code syntax:
{ref_syntax}

3. Reference existing code snippet:
{ref_code}

4. Previously generated code:
{gen_codes}

# STRICT RULES:
- This is a strict coding task. Do NOT assume, infer, or supplement any information beyond what is explicitly described in "1. Description of the new code to be generated." Any deviation from the description is considered an error.
- Do NOT imagine or create any additional code beyond what is specified in "1. Description of the new code to be generated." No assumptions are allowed.
- Only use "2. Reference code syntax" and "3. Reference existing code snippet" as references for directly related sections. Ignore unrelated parts.
- If parameter names or identifiers are unclear, **strictly follow** the naming conventions found in "3. Reference existing code snippet." Never introduce new names unless explicitly instructed.
- Maintain all content from "4. Previously generated code" exactly as is, unless a modification is clearly required. Do not lose any existing information. Append new code **after** the existing content.
- Follow IBM COBOL grammar, syntax, and formatting exactly. Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or additional text.
- Output must contain **only** the following:
  - The "Modified (or unchanged if no modification is needed) 4. Previously generated code"
  - The "Newly generated code snippet"
  - **No other information** is allowed.
- If "4. Previously generated code" is empty, omit that section entirely and output only the "Newly generated code snippet."
- This task requires strict compliance. Any deviation from the instructions is considered a failure.

# Example 1
Input:
1. Code Description
{exp_text}
2. Reference Code Syntax
(Omitted)
3. Reference Existing Code Snippet
(Omitted)
4. Previously Generated Code
           CALL 'JDB2INTF' USING SIGNON PGMNAME(Previously generated code)
Output:
COBOL Code Snippet
           CALL 'JDB2INTF' USING SIGNON PGMNAME(Previously generated code (modified or unchanged))
      {exp_code}(Newly generated code)

# Example 2
Input:
1. Code Description
{exp_text}
2. Reference Code Syntax
(Omitted)
3. Reference Existing Code Snippet
(Omitted)
4. Previously Generated Code

Output:
COBOL Code Snippet
      {exp_code}(Newly generated code)
