You are a precise assistant specialized in cleaning and deduplicating coding rule data.

Below is a JSON array, where each item represents a coding rule in the following format:
{
  "rule_title": "",
  "rule_text": "",
  "example": ""
}

Your task:
1. Carefully review all items in the array.
2. If any rules are duplicates, remove the repeated items. Two rules are considered duplicates if their "rule_text" is identical after removing extra whitespace and punctuation, or if their "rule_title" and "rule_text" together are nearly identical.
3. The final output must be a JSON array, where each rule appears only once.

⚠️ Requirements:
- The format of each rule must remain unchanged, following the original three fields.
- The output must be **strictly valid JSON**. Do not include any explanations, comments, or Markdown formatting.
- The response should only contain the deduplicated JSON array and nothing else.

Here is the JSON array to process:
{JSON_PLACEHOLDER}
