Step 2 - Diff Patch (Required)

- For each correction, output a diff as a separate code block using ```diff ... ``` format.
- For each `-` line (deletion), the indentation, alignment, and all whitespace **must be exactly as in the original COBOL code**.
- For each `+` line (addition), the indentation, alignment, and whitespace should be according to the ruleâ€™s requirement:
    - If the rule requires a change in indentation, reflect the new indentation in the `+` line.
    - If the rule only requires a code fix without indentation change, keep the indentation as in the original line.
- Only include the minimum lines needed to show the change. Do not include extra context lines unless required for clarity.
- Each code block must only include a single change location (all related lines grouped).
- **Do not output explanations, patch headers, or the entire modified file.**
- Repeat this code block format for each correction.

Example:
```diff
-      PERFORM ITF1-READ-RTN
-      PERFORM ITF2-READ-RTN
+           PERFORM ITF1-READ-RTN.
+           PERFORM ITF2-READ-RTN.
